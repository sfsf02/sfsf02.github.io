# 🏴‍☠️ Wanted: SafSec

> **Welcome to my cybersecurity blog — a space where curiosity meets practical security knowledge.**

I am a cybersecurity enthusiast passionate about understanding **how systems work**, **how they fail**, and **how they can be secured**.

My journey focuses on **ethical hacking**, **vulnerability research**, and **hands-on experimentation** with real-world security concepts. I believe cybersecurity is best learned by building, breaking, and improving systems responsibly.

###  My Goal
To continuously grow as a security researcher while helping others who are starting—or advancing—their own cybersecurity journey. This blog documents the challenges, the discoveries, and the skills developed along the way.

*Cybersecurity is not just about hacking — it is about thinking critically, learning continuously, and building systems that are safer for everyone.*
